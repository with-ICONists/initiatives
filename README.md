# initiatives
This is a repository for tracking the initiatives being co-run with ICONists

See past, present, and planned [initiatives](./initiatives/)

An initiative is an endeavor that is important to the development of a project in the ICON ecosystem. For example, beta testing an app, developing a website, marketing a product. This DAO is dedicated to the smooth and useful execution of initiatives that promote products in the ecosystem to increase usability, adoption, and robustness

Feel free to reach out on Discord to coordinate to pursue some initiative with ICONists!
