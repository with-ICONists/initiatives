# initiatives
This is a repository for tracking the initiatives being co-run with ICONists

See past, present, and planned [initiatives](./initiatives/)

An initiative is an endeavor that is important to the development of a project in the ICON ecosystem. For example, beta testing an app, developing a website, marketing a product. This DAO is dedicated to the smooth and useful execution of initiatives that promote products in the ecosystem to increase usability, adoption, and robustness

Feel free to reach out on Discord to coordinate to pursue some initiative with ICONists!

# In Practice
by standard practice, initiatives shall be pursued based on community vote, although in the initial stages (~first 6 months) of the DAO, initiatives may be pursued by direct recommendation from a DAO leader (John Hooley, Arosh Ediriweera, Eric Solomon)

 - Promotion of projects to be done via announcement channels within [ICON Discord](https://discord.gg/b5QvCXJjJM), broadcasts of these cchannels reach to any servers following - currently numbering 436
 - A twitter handle is to be created for the DAO to promote initiatives, this media can be retweeted by the ICON community handle for further exposure.
 - Any submissions required in line with the initiative can be handled via the [ICON Zealy platform](https://zealy.io/c/icx/).
 - The [ICON Zealy platform](https://zealy.io/c/icx/) can also be leveraged to drive engagement to tweets.
