## Intro
Incentivize usage for Drogon tool


## Summary

Drogon tool could be the most popular developer tool in the growing ICON ecosystem. However, it needs to be further promoted and possibly debugged for developers. For this, we are using our budget ($2k bnUSD) to incentivize usage of the tool

[Drogon](https://github.com/icon-community/drogon) is partnering with ICONists, a DAO by John and Arosh (Discord Managers), in order to gather community members and track results

## Incentivization

- $1250 bnUSD for 25 simple projects
  - $50 bnUSD per project
- $750 bnUSD for 3 high-quality projects
  - $250 bnUSD per project
  - 3 developers selected by Drogon team + ICON Foundation + ‘withICONists DAO’

## Projects

*Projects must contain one or more of the following domains*

- DAO with agora + [IRC 2](https://github.com/icon-project/IIPs/blob/master/IIPS/iip-2.md), [IRC 3](https://github.com/icon-project/IIPs/blob/master/IIPS/iip-3.md), or [IRC 31](https://github.com/icon-project/IIPs/blob/master/IIPS/iip-31.md)
- DEX
- Game using Unity SDK
- Voting contract
- Crowd funding
- File reference system using IPFS
- Real-world asset management (e.g. with associated certificates)
- Templates for the [tackle](https://github.com/sudoblockio/tackle) tool by SudoBlockIO
  - Projects requiring templating [here](https://github.com/sudoblockio/tackle-icon-contract/tree/main/templates)
  - For example, fill in the methods in the [IRC2 example contract](https://github.com/sudoblockio/tackle-icon-contract/blob/main/templates/irc2/src/main/java/com/iconloop/score/example/%7B%7Bcontract_slug%7D%7D.java ) with high-quality code

### Requirements

- All projects must be completely open-source, preferably using MIT or similar open license
- All projects must be able to go through the following steps in a common computing environment
  - Clone, build, test, sandbox test, deploy
- All projects must show example deployments and usage on testnet and contain instructions for usage
- All projects must be suitable to be used as example projects. Good example projects include the following ([fastapi example](https://github.com/apryor6/fastapi_example), [react example](https://github.com/Rhymond/product-compare-react), [solidity + nextjs](https://github.com/tomhirst/solidity-nextjs-starter)) 
- High quality projects must include highly detailed project interaction flow, including detailed documentations. An associated front-end app or widget would be highly desirable
- High quality projects are subject to higher scrutiny

## Communication and Verification

- ‘withICONists DAO’ is using the [ICON Zealy community](https://zealy.io/c/icx/questboard) to track participation and results
- Project promotion will be done by Drogon team + ICON Foundation + ‘withICONists DAO’
- Project validity judged by Drogon team + ICON Foundation + ‘withICONists DAO’
- To be eligible to receive a reward, projects are required to submit 1) link to open git repository, 2) interactable project demo, 3) link to live contracts on test network with instructions for usage
