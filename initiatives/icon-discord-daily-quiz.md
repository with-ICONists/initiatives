# ICON Discord Daily Quiz

## Intro
Daily engagement/education activity for the ICON Discord


## Summary

The ICON Discord Daily Quiz is an event running each weekday since 18/04/2022, where community members answer MCQ style questions based around a core theme for the week. The quiz runs for a 24 hour period allowing members to all time zones adequate time to research and answer questions. This is followed by a daily live draw in the discord where the 3 winners win 10 ICX each. 

Topics are selected to reflect current core ICON initiatives or to highlight projects building on ICON via collaborations. Collaborators also offer additional prizes to the community and provide valuable feedback on their experience with the daily quiz (listed below, under Testimonials).

## Incentivization

- 150 $ICX provisioned weekly for participants
- Additional situational prizes offered occasionally by collaborators

## Communication

- Notifications relating to the initiative can be posted to the [icon_bulletin](https://discord.com/channels/880651922682560582/908791090184867850) channel. As a result of agreeable feedback that this shouldn't live in the main announcement channel for ICON related news.
- CTA's for the initiative can be tagged using the **@Took Part** or **@Quiz Pass** roles
- Quizzes run for 24 hrs starting at 1100 UTC time each weekday, with a prize draw immediately following at 1100 UTC the following day.
- The onus is on winners to chase up their prize throughout the week, at the end of the week the Community Manager (operating the quiz that week) will check if we have recorded wallets for outstanding prizes and distribute those they are able to.
- Templates exist to share Daily Quiz questions via twitter, preferably via the [@helloiconworld](https://twitter.com/helloiconworld) or [@withICONists](https://twitter.com/withICONists) handles.

## Submission

- Participant submission occurs via reaction roles in the [Daily_Quiz Channel](https://discord.com/channels/880651922682560582/964308657749782599)
- Collaboration requests can be made directly to Arosh or John (Community Managers) in the ICON Discord server or via DM.

## Collaboration Testimonials

This section will include testimonials from Q4 2022 (when we began collecting them), in order to include those in the new reporting.

### Pengwyn BINC (05 Dec & 20 Feb)

**KPIs**
‚ÄúMost of the user inflow came through ICON Discord Daily Quiz events so we are grateful! Some of them also became NFT holders of the Pengwyn Project. It is perhaps the best marketing tool to set up the core community in the beginning. Of course the participants generally are the same in ICON discord so the user inflow from our last event (despite we increased the total rewards to 400 ICX) was very low. I believe it was because the participants were the same and already joined our server.
I believe we have earned more than 100 users from ICON discord and currently we have about 165 users in our discord.‚Äù

**Ideas for Improvement**
‚Äú-Setting up a bigger prize at the end of each month. We could ask 4 different questions from the 4 different projects that participated in the weekly events. This monthly event could be live. 
-One of the questions on each week could be coming from an AMA. Each week projects can choose a day and then give information about the project and then there could be a live question like you did in the summer quiz event. This could increase participation and benefit both parties at the same time.‚Äù

### 16-Bit Fight Club (12 Dec)

**KPIs**
‚ÄúThe spotlight 16BFC received while being a feature project for a week during December resulted in a significant boost to the 16BFC discord server members (approx 50 new people joined taking our total members over 200 for the first time)

This far exceeded our expectations during a bear market, and shows that there are still plenty of people out there within the ICON ecosystem looking for active and exciting projects to get involved with. I honestly wasn't entirely prepared to accommodate so many new members, and I'll definitely handle things a little differently next time.

**PROS:**
- John's knowledge of the 16BFC project was amazing. He had done his homework and presented facts better than I could have myself.
- The Daily-Quiz draws were handled in a fun and highly professional manner, despite me not being present for most of them
- As a result of the exposure, 16BFC's discord server welcomed around 50 new community members = HUGE!
- Winners of the Daily Quiz draws are integrated into the 16BFC ecosystem via the raffle ticket allocation

**CONS:**
- approx 80% of new members joining the 16BFC server left within 24hrs
--> (this is likely due to 16BFC not offering any immediate investment opportunities)
- my readiness to welcome new members could have been much better (lesson learned here)

OVERALL: extremely happy with how this went, and I've taken some learnings from the experience. I'm looking forward to doing this again once season two kicks off, and I'll be far more prepared!

Thank you to John & Arosh for running such a tight ship in the ICON discord. It can get pretty hectic in there sometimes and they always do such an incredible job of keeping the peace without stifling debate -their ability to walk such a fine line every day is a testament to both their social competence and professionalism üëè

### Studio Mirai (16 Jan)

‚ÄúEncryptos is new
Yea we got 1
The Jaba ban was nice too
Since our server prefers actual people and not only for reward seekers, maybe in the future we can do some activity
Perhaps an event
To drive people in
Icon quizzes I feel like are only geared towards the winners
For these type of initiatives
Like if took it and it didn‚Äôt win, I wouldn‚Äôt join‚Äù

**KPIs**
During the collaboration quiz, 51 individuals onboarded to the Studio Mirai server. Of which 20 completed the servers sign up and 2 can be considered a continually active community member (as of a month later).

Ben remains open to future collaborative events but raises the thought that the reward for participants only incentivises winners and if he didn‚Äôt win he probably wouldn‚Äôt play again.

### Alter (27 Feb)

Just want to say thanks for letting and helping Alter do the weekly Quiz, we see some great results!

**KPIs**
60 new discord members
20 new crew3 members 
10/15 new twitter followers
Slight increase in discord activity (This would likely be more if I had more time to dedicate to discord)

I have no complaints however one thing I think is a powerful combination is having Crew3 and the quizzes/ quest from ICON. I see a nice boost on likes/ retweets/ comments etc from Crew3 that come from ICON. 

So I would suggest upcoming projects doing quizzes look into setting a crew3 up before to boost engagement during quiz week!

Really happy with the results, thanks again man!

## Operation Notes

During this quarter we intend to try a few different things. The format for the quiz has remained consistent for the previous year and has successfully retained its audience throughout the bear market, now we will see if we can broaden the scope of it to more difficult or situational tasks (see end note marked *).

The first of such experiments did reduce participation, as rather than hosting quizzes in the usual channel format we necessitated signing up to Crew3 (week 5). This affirms that we can expect a reduction in participation if we ask more from the community than hunting out answers to questions in a linear way. In the future perhaps we can have one day per week that is earmarked for such a task.

Additional KPIs that we can look at are; 
Total count of community members who have participated in the Daily Quiz (at some point)
Users onboarded to sub-communities through collaborations
Page visits (for specific quiz questions)

We intend to keep the daily quiz on as our daily community engagement event, the format seems to work well and allows the whole community to take part in some form as it runs across the 24hr period.

With respect to our collaborations, the feedback we have received so far has been very positive. Taking feedback on board it may be good to host AMA‚Äôs with the collaborating project during their quiz week (as Pengwyn suggests), in a time that is suitable for them and not necessarily within the Quiz Draw VC.
In response to Ben‚Äôs point on a disincentive to take part due to not winning, we see that the audience has been stable throughout the bear. Though admittedly this doesn‚Äôt account for one time participants that may not be represented, indeed our total of individuals who have taken part comes in at 1247 - though this is made up in part out of individuals during the bull market and those participating in passing during the KuCoin events (lots of bots), that may/have drifted now.

We also see that the daily quiz collab is a greater value proposition for projects with a particular need to focus on growing their early audience or reconnect with said audience that may have drifted. As opposed to projects that may already have reached a high percentage of the existing ICON community.

It also seems that participation is improved during collaboration weeks. Either through greater participation flowing from those communities or through the promise of greater reward for participation.

*note. Further confirmation from additional Crew3 and interoperability weeks that participation drops markedly when additional steps and/or high difficulty questions are used. The first came as little surprise for a casual initiative, but the latter suggests that many people would prefer to not answer at all than chance getting the question wrong.
